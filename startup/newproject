# A New Start {#newproject}

Let's continue by creating a new project. You have two choices: [The
Script Way](#newproject_script) or [The FTP Way](#newproject_ftp). You
probably want to try The Script Way first, if possible.

## The Script Way {#newproject_script}

_The scripts are currently very rough around the edges and some commands
don't even work anymore. The scripts are planned to be moved into their
own branches, until polished._

Open a console to your server (either via SSH or just a new terminal
window). For this example, let's do a new project under your user's web
directory, so you'll probably want to start with

    $ cd ~/public_html/
    $ mkdir testproject
    $ cd testproject
    
Now you need to remember the path to where you installed LightFrame.
Let's say the path was `/opt/lightframe/a1`, so you'd write

    $ php /opt/lightframe/a1/scripts/lf_setup.php startproject

You should get output like

    : htaccess > /home/henrikpaul/public_html/testproject
    : index.php > /home/henrikpaul/public_html/testproject
    : settings.php > /home/henrikpaul/public_html/testproject
    : urls.php > /home/henrikpaul/public_html/testproject

## The FTP way {#newproject_ftp}

# Testing It {#test}

At this point, it might be good to check that everything's set up
properly &ndash; just to make sure.

Unfortunately, this is not as trivial as the two steps before, _yet_.
For now, it's a bit of manual labor, and you have two ways of
accomplishing this.

## The Script Way {#test_script}

First, open up a terminal to the computer you have installed your copy
LightFrame (open a console window, SSH, PuTTY, or what ever you are used
to). To make sure that you have a working PHP-CLI installed, write:

    $ php --version
    
You might expect a response like:

    PHP 5.2.6 (cli) (built: Jul 17 2008 23:04:49) 
    Copyright (c) 1997-2008 The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2008 Zend Technologies

If you, however, get

    -bash: php: command not found
    
There's something wrong with the PHP-CLI install (like, it isn't there).
Solving this problem isn't in the scope of this manual (try
[PHP's][php_install]).

[php_install]: http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php

Then type the following commands:

    $ LF_PATH="/absolute/path/to/lightframe"
    $ chmod u+x $LF_PATH/scripts/lf_setup.php
    $ alias lf_setup="$LF_PATH/scripts/lf_setup.php"

Since that .php script is
