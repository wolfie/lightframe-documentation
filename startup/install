# Getting LightFrame

You have two options of getting LightFrame:

**One:** Download a [ZIP][zip] archive (or [TAR][tar]) of the [current master][repo] branch.
<br>
**Two:** Use [Git][git] to clone the public repository (`git clone git://github.com/wolfie/lightframe.git`)

# Installing LightFrame

There's nothing to install in LightFrame _per se_. You just copy the files somewhere,
and it's ready to be used. Technically, the files aren't required to be anywhere
special. Just as long as Apache can reach and read the files, any location will.

You can have one global installation of LightFrame per server, or one per project.
Both approach has its pros and cons. The global approach is easy to maintain,
because it's in a central place, but it's best to keep them explicitly versioned
(for example, `/opt/local/LightFrame/alpha1/` for the Alpha 1 release, and
`/opt/local/LightFrame/master/` for automatically updated master branch). Otherwise
you might break projects unintentionally between two updates.
