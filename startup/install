# Getting LightFrame

You have two options of getting LightFrame:

**One:** Download a [ZIP][zip] archive (or [TAR][tar]) of the [current master][repo] branch.
<br>
**Two:** Use [Git][git] to clone the public repository (`git clone git://github.com/wolfie/lightframe.git`)

There you have it, the latest and greatest version of LightFrame. Easy, huh?

***Note on using the current master***: Under normal circumstances, it
might be hazardous to get the latest edits of a given project.
LightFrame is, however, currently being developed in such a way, that
the master branch is the most trusted one. All the new features are
programmed in separate branches. _The point is_, you should (for now, at
least) always prefer the current master over any previously tagged
commit.

# Installing It

There's nothing to install! You just decompress (if you chose to
download an archive file) and copy the files somewhere, and it's ready
to be used. Technically, the files aren't even required to be in any
special location; just as long as Apache can reach and read the files,
any location will do.

**Hint:** There might be some security advantages in having LightFrame's
files somewhere unreachable directly by Apache (i.e. not inside, or
above, `~/public_html` nor the server's webroot, like `/var/www`)

**Hint:** You can have one global installation of LightFrame per server,
or one per project. Both approach has its pros and cons. The global
approach is easy to maintain, because it's in a central place, but it's
best to keep them explicitly versioned (for example,
`/opt/local/LightFrame/alpha1/` for the Alpha 1 release, and
`/opt/local/LightFrame/master/` for automatically updated master
branch). Otherwise you might break projects unintentionally between two
updates.
