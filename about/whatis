# What is LightFrame? {#whatis}

LightFrame is a [web framework][wikipedia_waf] for PHP 5.1 (and newer).

It enforces an [MVC][wikipedia_mvc]-like decoupling structure, called
_UMTV_, for increased [code decoupling][wikipedia_decouple] and, thus,
maintainability.

The **URL dispatcher** lets you design beautiful URLs. Your application
doesn't control how it presents itself to the public, _you_ do.

**Model**s are used to interact with the database in a natural object
oriented way. If you want to save an object to the database, just do it!
There's no need to write SQL queries.

Display your elegant webpages with a powerful **Template** engine. The
dynamic presentation logic on top of vanilla (X)HTML and CSS makes
keeping your layouts fresh effortless.

**View**s bind all this together, by collecting the needed data from
Models, processing the data, and forwarding what's needed to Templates.
