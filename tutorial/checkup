# Preparing for the Action {#action}

We'll continue where we left off with our project stub. You should have
a project set up so that the default content gets displayed without any
errors or warnings &ndash; easily noticeable by the distinct lack of any
404 or 500-errors.

# Prepping the Database {#db}

For this tutorial, we'll use the database. Unfortunately, you need to
set the database up yourself, as LightFrame doesn't currently have any
automated tools to do that for you ([#137](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/lightframe/tickets/137)).

The database schema is as follows:

    // TODO: insert one here, once the Models are known

Remember to modify your `settings.php` accordingly, as you need to
modify the `LF_SQL_*` configurations for LightFrame to be aware of your
database. For the MySQL example for above, I'd write something in the
lines of:

    <?php
    ...
    define ('LF_SQL_RDBMS',  'mysql');
    define ('LF_SQL_HOST',   'localhost');
    define ('LF_SQL_DBNAME', 'lfwiki');
    define ('LF_SQL_USER',   'lfwiki');
    define ('LF_SQL_PASS',   'secretpassword');
    ...

# Check, Check and Check {#check}

Let's check that everything else is ready to begin, so we start at a
common point:

The path structure should be as follows:

    apps/
    templates/
    .htaccess
    index.php
    settings.php
    sqlite.db
    urls.php
    
You should have `settings.php` configured so that `LF_APPS_PATH` points
to the `apps/` directory, and `LF_TEMPLATES_PATH` points to the
`templates/` directory. This example also assumes that you have Apache's
`mod_rewrite` enabled, and both `settings.php` and `.htaccess`
configured accordingly.

Last, but not least, when visiting the URL of the project, it should
display the default LightFrame page, indicating a functioning
environment.
