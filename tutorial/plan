# The Plan {#plan}

Before we proceed to the coding itself, there are some things that are
important things we need to mention.

The code in this example is far from what should be considered
production ready, safe, or even stabile. While the end result is
something functional, it shouldn't be used for anything important.
Actually, it shouldn't be used for anything &ndash; strike that; it's
better if you just erase it altogether once you followed it once.

The code might also be ugly at some parts, or represent procedures that
aren't recommended. In these kinds of situation, it will be explicitly
mentioned.

The code has been whipped together for its educational values only. Use
it to understand the framework, tamper and play with it, to see what
happens when you modify it. But, to be absolutely clear, do not use it
for anything else than for your own amusement, or you _will_ get hacked.

Just your friendly warning&hellip;

# The Do's and Don'ts {#features}

Let's define the scope of the example, what it does, and what it
doesn't:

The project in question will be a light [wiki][wiki]. It won't be using
a markup language traditionally found at wikis, as HTML will be used
instead. You will be able to create new pages, edit existing ones and
delete unwanted pages.

On the other hand, there will not be any kind of login system, nor
restrictions on who can do what &ndash; it's an open system. The project
will also lack any kind of revision system, and no history or statistics
in any shape or form.

Simply put: it's just an open online doodle-board.
